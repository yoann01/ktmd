## What is Katana?

Katana is a highly efficient, collaborative look development and lighting solution that gives you the creative scope and scalability to meet the needs of today€s most demanding CG-rendering projects. Equally suited to both short and long-form animation and VFX projects, Katana's unique design lets you work with massive scenes and high volumes of shots; easily reuse looks; and make revisions without repeating scene setup work, so you can spend more time achieving higher quality results.
