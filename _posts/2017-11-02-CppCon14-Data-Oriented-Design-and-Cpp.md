# CppCon 2014: Mike Acton "Data-Oriented Design and C++"

{% include youtubePlayer.html id="rX0ItVEVjHc" %}

The transformation of data is the only purpose of any program. 
Common approaches in C++ which are antithetical to this goal will
be presented in the context of a performance-critical domain (console game development). 
Additionally, limitations inherent in any C++ compiler and how that affects 
the practical use of the language when transforming that data will be demonstrated.
