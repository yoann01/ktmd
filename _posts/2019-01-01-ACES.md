### ACES setup in Houdini

In the Houdini preferences folder you can find the Houdini environment config file:
> - Linux:  ~/houdiniX.X/houdini.env
> - Mac:  ~/Library/Preferences/houdini/X.X/houdini.env
> - Windows:   %HOME%/houdiniX.X/houdini.env                                                        
Open this file with a text editor.                                                      
Put a new line at the bottom:
OCIO = " the path to the OCIO config file, like ...../ACES_1.0.3/config.ocio , with quotes "

In the 3D view right click on the eye icon at the bottom left and chose Color Correction. If you see the ACES in that rolldown menu, as shown above you're ready. 
If not, click on the small button with the triangle and set OpenColorIO, then in that rolldown menu switch on "Enable OpenColorIO".
The default linear color space is ACEScg, you can't change here, but with the next rolldown menu you can change the ODT (Output Device Transform). More info about the ACES system will arrive soon, check back later...

At the bottom of the Render and Composite views there are the same bars, just stowed at default, so you should click on that horizontal bar below the image area first to unhide it.

### ACES setup in Clarisse

> In Clarisse open Preferences (Ctrl+K) and in the Color Management section check Use Ocio Config File and set the Ocio Config File to the config.ocio file in the folder you extracted somewhere, like:  ..../ACES_1.0.3/config.ocio (or the Nuke folder, described above)
> Close the window and restart Clarisse.
> Open the Color Management preferences again and set Scene Color Space to
ACES => ACEScg - if you'd prefer to use industry standard settings
ACES => ACES2065-1 - if you want to reach all colours in the spectrum and beyond... (however doing calculations with just 3 channels in such a wide gamut needs extra care, and there are impossible colors in this space)
> - Default Display Color Space to
Output => Output sRGB - if you have a conventional monitor with sRGB color gamut
Output => P3-D60 - if you have a wide color gamut monitor with P3 DCI option (the P3-DCI setting in the ACES list is a bit pink for most cases, it is for DCI projectors)
> - You can leave Color Picker Color Space to the default.
