### Functions

1. Introducing function.
2. Retrun Type.
3. Application entry point.
4. Function pointer and std::function
5. Lambda function.



# function Pointer and std::function

if you want to store or pass a function. the simplest way of referencing a function 
is a function pointer.

```C
## pointer to variable
int * x = & z;
```
**pointer to function**
int(*x) (int) = &z; // x point to z

**function pointer syntax is painfull, consider using the std::function type**
```C
std::function<int(int)> f = z; // easy
std::function<returntype(arguments type)>
```
-------
# Lambda Functions

can we store entire functions (rather than pointers to function) in variables?

```C
void foo(){
    int32_t x = 123;

    auto increase_by_x = [&x](int32_t value)
    {
        return x + value;
    };

    int a = 1;
    int b = increase_by_x(a); /// b is 124
}
```

type name = [capturelist](parmeters){body};

[=] capture everything by value
[&] capture everything by reference
[x, &y] capture x by value, y by reference
[&, z] everythings by reference, excpet z by value

```C
int32_t one = 1;
auto f = [](int32_t x){return x + one}; // error ( variable not specified in the capture list)
```
