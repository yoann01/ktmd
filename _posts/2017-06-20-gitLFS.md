###Hello World
The **Hello World** project is a time-honored tradition in computer programming. It is a simple exercise that gets you started when learning something new. Let’s get started with GitHub!

**You’ll learn how to:**

> - Create and use a repository

Using Git LFS(Large File Support)
===================

-------------------

**Git Large File Storage (LFS)** replaces large files such as audio samples, videos, datasets, and graphics 
with text pointers inside Git, while storing the file contents on a remote server like GitHub.com or GitHub Enterprise.

#### <i class="icon-upload"></i> [DOWNLOAD](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/releases/download/v2.3.4/git-lfs-windows-2.3.4.exe)

*1.*
**Download** and install the Git command line extension. You only have to set up Git LFS once.
```
git lfs install
```
*2.*
Select the file types you'd like Git LFS to manage (or directly edit your .gitattributes). You can configure additional file extensions at anytime.

```
git lfs track "*.psd"
```
*3.*
Make sure .gitattributes is tracked
```
git add .gitattributes
```
*4.*
There is no step three. Just commit and push to GitHub as you normally would.

```
git add file.psd
git commit -m "Add design file"
git push origin master

```
