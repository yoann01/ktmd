What is USD?
===================

Pipelines capable of producing computer graphics films and games typically generate, store, and transmit great quantities of 3D data,
which we call "scene description".  Each of many cooperating applications in the pipeline  (modeling, shading, animation, lighting, fx,
rendering) typically has its own special form of scene description tailored to the specific needs and workflows of the application,
and neither readable nor editable by any other application. **Universal Scene Description (USD) is the first publicly 
available software that addresses the need to robustly and scalably interchange and augment arbitrary 3D scenes that may be composed
from many elemental assets.**
