What is USD?
===================

Pipelines capable of producing computer graphics films and games typically generate, store, and transmit great quantities of 3D data,
which we call "scene description".  Each of many cooperating applications in the pipeline  (modeling, shading, animation, lighting, fx,
rendering) typically has its own special form of scene description tailored to the specific needs and workflows of the application,
and neither readable nor editable by any other application. **Universal Scene Description (USD) is the first publicly 
available software that addresses the need to robustly and scalably interchange and augment arbitrary 3D scenes that may be composed
from many elemental assets.**


[Introduction to USD](https://graphics.pixar.com/usd/docs/index.html)


**What is USD: A USD primer**
---

-> A file format wich describes a Scene Graph.
-> Describes geometry, animation, lights, cameras and shaders.
-> Reference USD files, or "composite" files on top of each other.


**How Does that help?**
---

- It's a single place where you can describe your ENTIRE scene in one
  open file format.

| ASSETS | Modeling | LookDev |

| SHOTS | Layout | Animation | Effects | Lighting |


- Each shot can be described in a single file. 
- USD file per departpment
- Each department can non-destructively edit the 
  information passed in from all the previous departments.
- No matter which depart opens SHOT.usd, they see the latest input from all
  departments(if they want to).
- A layout artist can hit "Render" and see exactly the same output that the
  lighter would see, which lets them build better layouts.
 
```sh
SHOT.usd
|
|____layout.usd
|    |___Asset_1.usd
|    |___Asset_2.usd
|
|____Animation.usd
|    |___Character_1.usd
|    |___Character_2.usd
|
|____Fx.usd
|____Lighting.usd

```

# STAGE

The resulting composition of your Layers.

**Composition arcs**
---

> Different ways to combine layers or parts of layers 
  to construct a stage.

**Sublayer**
---

```sh

SET_A.usd
|
|____Set_A1.usd
|
|____Set_A2.usd
|    |___Cube1
|    |___Sphere1


SET_B.usd
|
|____Set_B1.usd
|
|____Set_B2.usd
     |___Cube1
     |___Sphere1

```
**SET_A.usd and SET_B.usd combined.**
 
```sh
/
|
|____Set_A1
|
|____Set_A2.usd
|    |___Cube1
|    |___Sphere1
|
|____Set_B1
|
|____Set_B2.usd
     |___Cube1
     |___Sphere1
```

**NameSpace**
---

> "Path to the primitives in your scene graph".

**Opinions**
---

> "The atomic elements that participate in value resolution in USD".


**Sublayering**
---

- Fixed scene graph locations
- Sublayer per department.
- No conflicting edits or sharing issues

**References**
---

**Payloads**
---

- Manage memory and processing time.
- Only load what you want.

**Instancing**
---

**Variant Set**
---

> Set of alternatives, non-destructive

**Hydra**
---

> A rendering framework that defines an API a renderer
  must implement to receive incremental updates to a USD scene.
  
> One viewport, many renderes(OGL, Karma, Renderman , ProRender, Redshift)
  everything is IPR/live rendering.
