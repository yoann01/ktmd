### <span style="color:#5aade0">Designer ACES</span>
![](https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/021/308/091/large/calvin-simpson-comparison.jpg)

I added ACES tonemapping to the **Substance Designer** viewport shader for closer parity with UE4 which uses ACES filmic tonemapping.
Grab it from my git respository! (install instructions inside the readme) -

### <span style="color:#5aade0">Painter ACES</span>

LUTs for **Substance Painter(v2.5 and newer)** with the **ACES RRT/ODT** to better match other renderers, one with the standard ODT for \
something like Unity and one specifically for UE4 and its modification of ACES.\ This has NO impact on your materials, this is strictly a viewport feature.

v2 includes a pre-transformation fix and a more accurate LUT for Epic's version of ACES in Unreal Engine 4.\ Thanks Thomas Mansencal, Nick Shaw, and Jose Linares on **ACESCentral**.
